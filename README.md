# save-a-note

## Description
The motivation for this application is to apply the back end skills that I have learned during the past week in my coding bootcamp journey. I tried to utilize my skills with routes, middleware, and reviewing of prewritten code. Being able to work through another developers code is a crucial skill required for my personal ambitions in softwarer development. 
I learned and I continue to learn how much information that I am lacking and areas where I can personally develop to become a solid developer.



## Usage

The proper way to use this application is to utilize the link click get started adn you will be taken to a page where you can enter a title and text for a new note or you have the ability to view previous notes that were saved.
